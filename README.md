# Online shopper intention prediction

Example of code where I did data analysis and applied different Machine Learning algorithms.

Online Shopper Intention Dataset from UCI's Machine Learning Library

##Data Set Information:

The dataset consists of feature vectors belonging to 12,330 sessions.
The dataset was formed so that each session would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.
